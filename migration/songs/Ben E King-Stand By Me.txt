         LA
When the night has come
FA#m
  And the land is dark
        RE          MI               LA
And the moon is the only light we'll see
     LA                    FA#m
No I won't be afraid, oh I won't be afraid
        RE          MI              LA
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

   LA                                FA#m
So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me 
   RE    MI           LA
oh stand,  stand by me, stand by me

       LA
If the sky that we look upon
FA#m
  Should tumble and fall
        RE               MI             LA
And the mountains should crumble to the sea
        LA                     FA#m
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
        RE          MI              LA
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

   LA                                FA#m
So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me 
   RE       MI            LA
oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me
