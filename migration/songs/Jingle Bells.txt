DO  
Dashing through the snow
                    REm7  
On a one-horse open sleigh,
                   SOL7 
Over the fields we go,
                 DO  
Laughing all the way

Bells on bob-tail ring,
               REm7  
Making spirits bright,
                   SOL7 
What fun it is to ride and sing
                   DO     SOL7 
A sleighing song tonight

DO  
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way!
FA           DO  
O what fun it is to ride
     RE7           SOL7 
In a one-horse open sleigh
DO  
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way!
FA           DO  
O what fun it is to ride

  DO  
A day or two ago,
                     REm7  
I thought I'd take a ride,
                    SOL7 
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
                 DO  
Was seated by my side

The horse was lean and lank
                      REm7  
Misfortune seemed his lot
SOL7 
He got into a drifted bank,
                 DO   SOL7 
And we, we got upsot

DO  
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way!
FA           DO  
O what fun it is to ride

  DO  
A day or two ago,
                 REm7  
The story I must tell
                  SOL7 
I went out on the snow
                 DO  
And on my back I fell

A gent was riding by
                    REm7  
In a one-horse open sleigh,

He laughed as there
  SOL7 
I sprawling lie,
                   DO   SOL7 
But quickly drove away

DO  
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way!

In a one-horse open sleigh

DO  
Now the ground is white
                   REm7  
Go it while you're young,
                 SOL7 
Take the girls tonight
                        DO  
And sing this sleighing song

Just get a bob-tailed bay
                 REm7  
Two-forty as his speed
SOL7 
Hitch him to an open sleigh
                           DO   SOL7 
And crack! you'll take the lead

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
