I found a love for me
              REbadd9                     MIb
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
                LAb         FAm7
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
            REbadd9                               MIb
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
                                 LAb
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
            FAm7
Not knowing what it was
           REbadd9          LAb MIb
I will not give you up this time
                  LAb
But darling, just kiss me slow
              FAm7
Your heart is all I own
            REbadd9              MIb
And in your eyes you're holding mine

      FAm REbadd9        LAb
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
     MIb            FAm7
With you between my arms
REbadd9         LAb
Barefoot on the grass
MIb              FAm7
Listening to our favourite song
         REbadd9           LAb
When you said you looked a mess
            MIb           FAm7
I whispered underneath my breath
        REb
But you heard it,
         LAb      MIb
Darling, you look perfect..

Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
              REbadd9
She shares my dreams
                                   MIb
I hope that someday I'll share her home
          LAb            FAm7             
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
         REbadd9                        MIb
To carry love, to carry children of our own
                            LAb
We are still kids but we're so in love
          FAm7
Fighting against all odds
             REb             LAb MIb   
I know we'll be alright this time
              LAb
Darling, just hold my hand
                 FAm7
Be my girl, I'll be your man
         REb             MIb
I see my future in your eyes

      FAm REbadd9        LAb
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark

Barefoot on the grass
MIb              FAm7
Listening to our favourite song
       REbadd9         LAb
When I saw you in that dress

Looking so beautiful
