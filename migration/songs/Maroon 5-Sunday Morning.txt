  Sunday morning, rain is falling,
MIm7         LA7            RE7+
  steal some covers, share some skin
MIm9         LA13           REadd9
  Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable,
    MIm7             LA7          RE7+
you twist to fit the mold that I am in
    MIm7               LA13          REadd9
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do,
            MIm7           LA              RE7+
and I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew,
     MIm9             LA13            REadd9
that someday it would lead me back to you,
     MIm7             LA             RE7+
that someday it would lead me back to you

            MIm7   LA7/6 RE7+
That may be all... I...  need,
                   MIm7   LA7/6 RE7+
In darkness she is all... I...   see
                   MIm7     LA7/6  RE7+
Come and rest your bones... with... me
                       MIm7
Driving slow on Sunday morning,
      LA7/6    RE7+
and I never want to leave

MIm9      LA7/5+             RE7+
  Fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah, yeah,
MIm7      LA7             RE7+
  paint a picture with my hands
MIm9       LA13               REadd9
  Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm,
             MIm7             LA            RE7+
  change the weather, still together when it ends

            MIm7   LA7/6 RE7+
That may be all... I...  need,
                   MIm7   LA7/6 RE7+
In darkness she is all... I...   see
                   MIm7     LA7/6  RE7+
Come and rest your bones... with... me
                       MIm7
Driving slow on Sunday morning,
      LA7/6    RE7+
and I never want to leave

Sunday morning, rain is falling, and I'm calling out to you
        MIm9          LA13             REadd9
Singing someday it'll bring me back to you,
       MIm7           LA7               RE7+
find a way to bring myself back home to you
