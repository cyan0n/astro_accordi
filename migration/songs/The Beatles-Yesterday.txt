Yesterday,  All my troubles seemed so far away,
RE      MI                      LA
  Now it looks as though they're here to stay,
    FA#m  SI7    RE   LA   
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
LA       SOL#m7      DO#7            FA#m        FA#m/MI            
Suddenly,  I'm not half the man I used to be
RE         MI             LA
  There's a shadow hanging over me,
    FA#m   SI7     RE   LA              
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

DO#    DO#7   FA#m MI RE                                 
Why   she   had to go,
FA#m     SIm6     MI7      LA
I don't know, she wouldn't say.
DO#  DO#7  FA#m MI    RE                           
I   said something wrong,
FA#m   SIm6    MI7   LA                    
Now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday,  Love was such an easy game to play,
RE     MI              LA
  Now I need a place to hide away,
    FA#m  SI7    RE   LA
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
