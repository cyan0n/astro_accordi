If I fell in love with you 
          MIb 
would you promise to be true 
    RE      SIm
and help me understand?
           MIm
Cause I’ve been in love before 
      MIb 
and I found that love was more 
     FAm          SIb 
than just holding hands.
         MIb   FAm  SOLm     FAm  
1. If I  give  my   heart to you, 
  SIb 
I must be sure 
         MIb  FAm  SOLm       FAm  
from the ve___ry   start that you
      SIb               MIb  LAbm   SIb 
would love me more than her. 
        MIb   FAm SOLm    FAm  
2. If I trust in  you oh  please, 
      SIb 
don’t run and hide 
     MIb  FAm  SOLm   FAm  
If I love you  too oh please 
      SIb                MIb7
don’t hurt my pride like her, 
                           LAb
cause I couldn’t stand the pain 
    LAbm
and I, 
                        MIb     
would be sad if our new love, 
       SIb 
was in vain. 
        MIb  FAm  SOLm     FAm

SIb                    MIb7
when she learns we are two
                           LAb 
cause I couldn’t stand the pain 
    LAbm
and I, 
                        MIb     
would be sad if our new love, 
       SIb 
was in vain.
