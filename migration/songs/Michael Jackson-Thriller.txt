It's close to midnight, and something evil's, lurking in the dark
                         LAm7
Under the moonlight, you see a sight, that almost stops your heart
           RE7                                           LAm7

'Cos this is Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night

             LAm7                                              RE7
You hear the door slam, and realise there's nowhere left to run
             LAm7
You feel the cold hand, and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
               RE7                                   LAm7
You close your eyes, and hope that this is just imagi-nation
            RE7                                        FA/LA
