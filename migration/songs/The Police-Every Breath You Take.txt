FA                                         SOL
Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
                                      FA
I dream at night, I can only see your face
                                     SOL
I look around but it's you I can't replace
                                     FA
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
                          LA
I keep crying baby, baby, please
