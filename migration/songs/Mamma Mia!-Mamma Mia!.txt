RE          LA/RE      RE                      SOL
  I've been cheated by you, since I don't know when
RE   LA/RE      RE                       SOL
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
RE              RE5+
Look at me now,   will I ever learn?
RE                RE5+             SOL
I don't know how,   but I suddenly lose control
                   LA
There's a fire within my soul
SOL  RE/FA#  LA
Just one     look and I can hear a bell ring
SOL  RE/FA#  LA
One more     look and I forget everything.. woo oh

RE
Mamma mia, does it show again?
SOL4     SOL
  My my, just how much I've missed you

RE               LA/DO#
  Yes, I've been brokenhearted
SIm              FA#m/LA
  Blue since the day we parted
SOL4       MIm        LA
  Why, why did I ever let you go?

I've been angry and sad about the things that you do
RE      LA/RE         RE                             SOL
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
RE               RE5+
And when you go,   when you slam the door
RE                RE5+                 SOL
I think you know,   that you won't be away too long
                  LA
You know that I'm not that strong.
