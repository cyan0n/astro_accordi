    SOL     RE/FA# MIm SI7    MIm      LA7 RE
Oh, say can you   see, by the dawn’s early  light,
RE7/FA#  SOL        RE            SOL             
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming?
                        RE/FA#  MIm
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, 
SI7         MIm LA7 RE
through the perilous fight,
         SOL         RE               SOL
O’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?

        SOL                           RE7
And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
     SOL               RE             SOL  MIm7 LA7   RE      
Gave proof through the night that our flag was   still there
  SOL  LAm7 SOL/SI DO      MI7 LAm        RE4 RE7
O say, does that   star-spangled banner yet wa--ve
         SOL              MIm RE#6 SOL/RE
O’er the land of the free and  the   home 
   RE7 SOL
of the brave?
