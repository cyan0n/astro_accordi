 Broken bottles under children's feet

 Bodies strewn across the dead-end street

 But I won't heed the battle call
SIm  RE     SOL            
 It puts my back up against the wall

 There's many lost, but tell me who has won?
SIm           RE             SOL
 The trenches dug within our hearts
SIm           RE                  SOL
 And mother's children, brothers, sisters torn apart

 We eat and drink while tomorrow they die

 To claim the victory Jesus won,
